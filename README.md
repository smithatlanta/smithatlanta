### Hi, I'm Mike Smith

#### I'm currently an Architect(Cloud) with Warner Media(formerly Turner Broadcasting)

#### I'm currently working on a variety of projects(Around analytics).  Most of my code is private ðŸ˜¬ at the moment, but I do have some open source projects out at TurnerLabs github.

#### I'm a GCP Certified Architect with nearly 10 years of experience with AWS as well.  I'm currently learning more about Azure to round out my knowledge of all the cloud providers.
